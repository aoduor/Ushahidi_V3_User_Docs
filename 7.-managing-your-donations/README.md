Web monetization is a feature that will help deployers receive donations based on the number of traffic to/on their deployments.

Donations will only be possible when using the Puma browser for mobile or a Coil browser extension for desktop enabled and the users will only be able to donate if they have a Coil account.  
For the deployers to receive money, they will need to have an account on uphold.com. They can either choose to create an account as an organization or an individual. 

Nb: This will be discussed
